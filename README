NAME
    Task::Unicode - Everything needed to work with Unicode data

VERSION
    This document describes Task::Unicode version 0.05_1.

DESCRIPTION
    This Task module installs everything needed for working with Unicode and
    UTF-8 strings as well as a number of modules and utilities to assist in
    development and debugging. It is not intended to be an all-inclusive
    bundle of Unicode modules on the CPAN. Instead, it is a collection of
    the essential and some of the most useful general-purpose modules.

    This is an early release of Task::Unicode and the bundled module list is
    not yet complete. Modules may be added or removed. Please contact the
    author with suggestions for upcoming releases.

    The brief module descriptions are currently taken directly from each
    module. In the future, these will be slightly expanded and explained for
    those with less Unicode knowledge.
