=head1 NAME

Task::Unicode - Everything needed to work with Unicode data

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Task::Unicode version 0.05_1.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Task> module installs everything needed for working with Unicode and
UTF-8 strings as well as a number of modules and utilities to assist in
development and debugging.  It is not intended to be an all-inclusive bundle
of Unicode modules on the CPAN.  Instead, it is a collection of the essential
and some of the most useful general-purpose modules.

This is an early release of Task::Unicode and the bundled module list is not
yet complete.  Modules may be added or removed.  Please contact the author
with suggestions for upcoming releases.

The brief module descriptions are currently taken directly from each module.
In the future, these will be slightly expanded and explained for those with
less Unicode knowledge.
